*Agri-input marketplace + equipment rental platform for Indian farmers*
---

## 1. Final Problem Definition

Small and marginal farmers in India face two separate, well-documented frictions:

1. **Input access** — buying seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides through local dealers, with no easy way to compare prices, brands, or availability across sellers.
2. **Equipment access** — owning machinery like tractors or tillers is uneconomical for most small farms because usage is highly seasonal (intense demand at sowing/harvesting, idle otherwise). Renting is common but informal — arranged by phone call, with no standardized booking, pricing, or fairness when multiple farmers want the same machine in the same week.

Krishisetu solves both with one platform: an **input marketplace** (farmers buy from vendors) and an **equipment rental module** where equipment can come from individual farmers renting out idle machinery (C2C) *or* a dealer/fleet account (B2C) — with a fair, automated **FCFS queue + 24-hour confirmation window** replacing the informal "whoever calls first" system.

This is a scoped **student build**, not a commercial launch — pan-India in concept, generic rather than hyperlocal, deployed live for demonstration and evaluation.

## 2. Target Users & Roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **Farmer** | Primary user. Buys inputs from vendors. Can also list their own equipment for rent (C2C) and/or book equipment from others. |
| **Vendor** | Sells agricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizer, pesticides) through the marketplace. |
| **Equipment Owner** | Lists equipment for rent — either an individual farmer (same account type as Farmer, dual capability) or a dealer/fleet operator with multiple machines. |
| **Admin** | Platform operator (your team, for demo purposes) — approves listings, resolves disputes, monitors bookings/orders. |

Since you confirmed the same user can act as both buyer and equipment lister, **Farmer and Equipment Owner are the same account type** with an optional "list equipment" capability toggled on per user — this avoids duplicate account systems and matches how a real farmer would use the app.

Vendor accounts (input sellers) are a separate role, since a vendor is typically a business, not an individual farmer.

## 3. Final Requirements

**Functional — Marketplace (inputs)**
- Vendor registration and product listing (name, category, price, stock, images, description)
- Farmer browsing, search, filter by category/price
- Cart, checkout, Razorpay payment
- Order history and status (placed → confirmed → shipped → delivered) — kept simple; no real logistics integration
- Vendor dashboard to manage listings and view orders

**Functional — Equipment Rental**
- Equipment listing (owner/dealer side): type, specs, rate (per day/hour), location, availability calendar
- Farmer search/filter by equipment type, location, date range
- Booking request → if the slot is contested, request enters an FCFS queue
- 24-hour confirmation window on the top of the queue; Spring `@Scheduled` job auto-expires unconfirmed bookings and promotes the next farmer in queue
- Booking status tracking: queued → confirmed → active → completed / expired / cancelled
- Owner dashboard: approve/reject, view booking calendar

**Non-functional**
- Mobile-responsive (many end users are mobile-first)
- Reasonably lightweight pages — assume patchy rural connectivity
- Reliable, demoable scheduled-job behavior — this is your strongest technical talking point in evaluation, so it must work predictably

**User requirements**
- Simple, low-friction registration and browsing (assume low digital literacy — keep flows short, use clear labels, avoid jargon)

**Technical requirements**
- backend, React frontend,database, deployed live

## 4. Proposed Solution

**Core solution:** One platform, two modules, one shared user identity — an input marketplace and an FCFS-queued equipment rental system, deployed live as a working demo.

## 5. MVP & Advanced Features

| Feature | Priority | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Auth (register/login, farmer & vendor roles) | 🔴 Critical | Nothing else works without it |
| Input product listing & browsing | 🔴 Critical | Core marketplace loop |
| Cart & Razorpay checkout | 🔴 Critical | Core marketplace loop |
| Equipment listing (owner side) | 🔴 Critical | Core rental loop |
| Equipment booking + FCFS queue + 24hr expiry job | 🔴 Critical | Your standout technical feature |
| Order/booking history & status | 🟡 Important | Expected UX, not hard to build |
| Search/filter (category, equipment type, location) | 🟡 Important | Usability, moderate effort |
| Admin panel (approve listings, view all orders/bookings) | 🟡 Important | Useful for demo and dispute-handling story |
| Ratings/reviews (vendors, equipment owners) | 🟢 Optional | Nice-to-have, add only if time remains |
| Email/SMS notifications on booking events | 🟢 Optional | Adds polish; skip if timeline tightens |
| Multi-language UI | 🟢 Optional (future) | Real-world relevant, but out of scope for 8–10 weeks with a beginner team |

**Explicitly out of scope:** AI/ML features of any kind (confirmed), logistics/delivery tracking, crop advisory, credit/lending features, hyperlocal geofencing.

## 6. User / System Workflow

**Marketplace flow:** Farmer registers → browses/searches products → adds to cart → checks out → order recorded → vendor sees order in dashboard → order status updated manually by vendor (placed/shipped/delivered).

**Rental flow:** Owner registers/lists equipment → farmer searches by type/date → farmer sends booking request → system checks slot:
- If free → booking auto-confirmed
- If contested → request joins FCFS queue → the farmer at the head of the queue gets a 24-hour confirmation window → confirms in time → booking locked in; doesn't confirm in time → `@Scheduled` job expires it and promotes the next farmer in queue automatically

**Admin flow:** Views all users, listings, orders, and bookings; can suspend a listing or user if needed for the demo.

## 7. AI & Automation Features

None — AI is explicitly excluded per your decision. The one automation feature retained is the **scheduled booking-expiry job**, which is genuine automation (not AI) solving a real fairness problem in the rental queue, and is worth highlighting in your project report as the platform's core engineering contribution.

## 8. Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why (given a beginner team) |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | Spring Boot (Java) | Already decided; strong for interviews; Spring Data JPA keeps DB code approachable once basics are learned |
| Frontend | React | Already decided; large beginner-friendly ecosystem and tutorials |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Already decided; free-tier hosting widely available (Render, Railway, Supabase) |
| Auth | Spring Security + JWT | Standard, well-documented pattern for Spring Boot beginners |
| Payments | Razorpay (test mode) | Already decided; has a sandbox that doesn't require real settlement |
| Scheduling | Spring `@Scheduled` | Already decided; no external job queue needed at this scale |
| Deployment (backend) | Render or Railway (free/low-cost tier) | Simplest path to "deployed" for a student team with no DevOps experience |
| Deployment (frontend) | Vercel or Netlify | Near-zero-config React deployment |
| Deployment (DB) | Managed PostgreSQL on Render/Railway/Supabase | Avoids self-hosting a database |

## 9. System Architecture (high level)

```
React (Vercel)  →  REST API  →  Spring Boot (Render)  →  PostgreSQL (Render/Supabase)
                                        ↓
                                   Razorpay API (payments)
                                        ↓
                          Spring @Scheduled job (runs inside the
                          same backend instance — polls bookings
                          table every few minutes for expired
                          unconfirmed holds)
```

Simple three-tier architecture: React SPA calling a Spring Boot REST API, backed by PostgreSQL. No microservices, no message queue — appropriate for team size, timeline, and experience level. The scheduled job runs in-process; no separate worker service needed at this scale.

## 10. Database Design (core entities)

- **User** — id, name, phone/email, password_hash, role flags (is_vendor, is_equipment_owner), location
- **Product** — id, vendor_id (FK→User), name, category, price, stock, description, image_url
- **Order** — id, farmer_id (FK→User), status, total_amount, razorpay_payment_id, created_at
- **OrderItem** — id, order_id (FK), product_id (FK), quantity, price_at_purchase
- **Equipment** — id, owner_id (FK→User), type, description, rate, rate_unit (hour/day), location
- **AvailabilitySlot** — id, equipment_id (FK), start_date, end_date, is_booked
- **BookingRequest** — id, equipment_id (FK), farmer_id (FK), requested_slot, status (queued/confirmed/expired/completed/cancelled), queue_position, confirmation_deadline

Relationships: one Vendor→many Products; one Farmer→many Orders→many OrderItems→one Product; one Owner→many Equipment→many AvailabilitySlots; one Equipment→many BookingRequests (queued), one active confirmed booking at a time.

## 11. API Requirements (representative, not exhaustive)

- `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login`
- `GET /products`, `GET /products/{id}`, `POST /products` (vendor), `PUT /products/{id}`
- `POST /orders`, `GET /orders/my`, Razorpay webhook/callback endpoint for payment confirmation
- `GET /equipment`, `POST /equipment` (owner), `GET /equipment/{id}/availability`
- `POST /bookings`, `GET /bookings/my`, `POST /bookings/{id}/confirm`
- `GET /admin/...` — protected admin-only endpoints

## 12. Security

- JWT-based session auth; role-based route protection (farmer/vendor/admin)
- Razorpay secret key kept server-side only, in environment variables — n
- Input validation on all forms (server-side, not just client-side)
- HTTPS enforced on deployed URLs (default on Render/Vercel)

## 13. Development Phases 


| Weeks | Focus |
|---|---|
| 1–2 | Learn basics: React fundamentals for members; set up Git repo, project skeleton, DB schema |
| 3–4 | Auth (register/login) end-to-end; basic product listing + browsing (marketplace skeleton) |
| 5–6 | Cart + Razorpay checkout; equipment listing + plain booking (no queue yet — get the simple path working first) |
| 7 | FCFS queue logic + `@Scheduled` expiry job |
| 8 | Admin panel, order/booking history views, UI polish |
| 9 | Deployment (backend, frontend, DB), end-to-end testing, bug fixing |
| 10 | Buffer week — testing, report writing, demo rehearsal |


## 14. Testing

- Manual end-to-end testing of both flows (marketplace purchase, rental booking with queue contention) before deployment
- Specifically test the expiry job with a short artificial timeout (e.g., 1–2 minutes instead of 24 hours) during development so you can actually observe the queue-promotion behavior without waiting a day
- Basic input validation testing (empty fields, invalid prices, past dates for bookings)
- Test Razorpay in sandbox/test mode only

## 15. Deployment

- Backend → FastAPI[PYTHON]
- Frontend → Vercel (React build deploy)
- Database → managed PostgreSQL instance on the same platform as backend, to avoid cross-network latency/config issues
- Environment variables (DB credentials, Razorpay keys, JWT secret)

## 16. Final Project Summary

Krishisetu is a two-module agritech platform: an input marketplace where farmers buy seeds/fertilizer/pesticides from vendors, and an equipment rental system where farmers or dealers list machinery and other farmers book it through a fairness-driven FCFS queue with automatic 24-hour-expiry handling. Built with React, FastAPI and PostgreSQL, deployed live. — the project's strength lies in a clean, correctly-implemented core workflow and a genuinely well-engineered scheduled-job queue mechanic.
